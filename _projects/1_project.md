Current keypoint descriptors for global localization often struggle with computational complexity. As an alternative, intermediate object-level descriptors leveraging topological and semantic information offer a more efficient approach. However, handcrafted topological descriptors are challenging to optimize and lack robustness against environmental noise, perspective changes, object occlusions, and detection errors.

To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method that models semantically meaningful object constellations as graphs. By utilizing Deep Graph Convolutional Networks, we generate compact and robust descriptors for these constellations.

Our Deep Learned Constellation Descriptor (Descriptellation) is evaluated on two real-world datasets. Despite being trained on randomly generated simulation data, it generalizes effectively to real-world scenarios. Descriptellation outperforms state-of-the-art methods and handcrafted descriptors in global localization, demonstrating resilience to various types of noise.

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
